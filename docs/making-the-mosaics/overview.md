# Overview

:::info
These steps are best carried out on a laptop/desktop computer, though a nimble user should be able to perform them on a mobile device as well.

In this application, the entire georeferencing process comprises three sequential steps, each with its own tool interface:

1. [Preparation (Splitting)](#preparation-splitting)
2. [Georeferencing](#georeferencing)

These steps need to be completed in order, but they don't have to be completed all in one sitting. In fact, Georeferencing and Trimming can be revisited at any time, so you can improve on your past work, or build from someone else's.

Tips for using each tool accompany its interface, and similar content is presented below as well.

When you are ready, you can [create a web map](#creating-web-maps) from layers that have been georeferenced.

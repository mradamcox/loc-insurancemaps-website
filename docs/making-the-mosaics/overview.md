# Overview

In this application, the entire process of making mosaics from the volume content comprises three sequential steps, each with its own tool interface:

1. [Preparating the Sheets (Splitting)](/docs/making-the-mosaics/preparation)
2. [Georeferencing the Documents](/docs/making-the-mosaics/georeferencing)
3. [Trimming the Layers](/docs/making-the-mosaics/trimming)

These steps need to be completed in order, but they don't have to be completed all in one sitting. In fact, Georeferencing and Trimming can be revisited at any time, so you can improve on your past work, or build from someone else's.

Tips for using each tool accompany its interface, and similar content is presented in the following pages as well.

:::note
These steps are best carried out on a laptop/desktop computer, though a nimble user *should* be able to perform them on a mobile device as well.

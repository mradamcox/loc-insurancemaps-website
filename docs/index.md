# LaHMG Documentation

Documentation is provided here to help you get around the platform ([Navigating the Site](/docs/navigate-the-site)) and use the tools ([Making the Mosaics](/docs/how-to-use-the-site)).

I have also collected a fair bit of information about the Sanborn Map company and the maps themselves, so there's a place for that too ([About Sanborn Maps](/docs/sanborn-maps/)). 

Finally, if you are technically inclined and/or want to use the mosaic layers in your own website or software, check out the [Technical Documentation](/docs/technical-docs/).

For more newsy information, check out the [blog](/blog).

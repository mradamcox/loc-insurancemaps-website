    "description": "From the late 1860's to early 1970's the Sanborn Map Company created detailed atlases of over 12,000 cities, towns, and villages, primarily in the U.S., but also a few in  as well as some in Canada, Mexico, and Cuba. Through the course of this project I have collected a lot of information about Sanborn maps, which I'm happy to be able to share with you here."

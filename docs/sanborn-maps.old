# Sanborn Maps - Briefly

The Sanborn Map Company surveyed and mapped American cities from the late 1860's through the 1950's, creating city atlases and selling them to insurance companies on a subscription basis. The extensive details they recorded for each building&mdash;commercial use, construction materials, exact locations of heat sources, to name but a few&mdash;provided insurance companies with the information they needed to geographically visualize and balance their risk.

Map production had begun to wind down in the 1950s, but usefulness of the collection as a historical reference (far beyond its original purpose) was already recognized. In all, the company mapped over 12,000 American communities, generally returning to each one every 5-7 years to create a full update. The result is an unparalled cartographic record of urban development in the U.S., and an archive with much potential.

In recent years, the advancement of geospatial and web technology has provided new ways to re-engage with these maps. For example, some companies sell access to their own georeferenced mosaics of the maps ([EDR](https://edrnet.com/introducing-sanborn-viewer/), [ERIS](https://www.erisinfo.com/eris-xplorer/), [FIMo](http://www.historicalinfo.com/fimo/)), some cities have free viewers ([Boston](https://atlascope.leventhalmap.org), [Bozeman](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=f4cf486b4d7f4988aa589e7dd989f5e9), [Milwaukee](http://webgis.uwm.edu/agsl/sanborn/)), and digital history projects use georeferenced maps as foundational materials ([Reconstructing Bloomington](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f38fd8915aa14f4e99b96455dcdad49e), [What the Tulsa Race Massacre Destroyed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/24/us/tulsa-race-massacre.html), [Homestead Hebrew Maps](https://maps.homesteadhebrews.com/)).

# Structure of the Sanborn Collection 

When the Sanborn Map company originally published these maps, all content for a given city in a given year was released in a single edition. However, in large cities like New Orleans one edition may actually comprise multiple volumes, and in the Library of Congress collection each of these volumes is stored as a separate item. Thus, we use **volume** as the highest level of grouping of historical maps. Each volume has one or more sheets that become **[Documents](#documents)** when the volume is loaded.

# Volumes in this Project

## Why isn't my city listed?
    
If a city does not appear in the "Start a new volume" list, then there is no Sanborn map of it in the LOC collection. However, do check for old names of your city, or the names of adjacent communinities that may have combined with yours over the years.

## Why are some volumes in the list grayed out?

This means the volume exists in the LOC collection but is not available for georeferencing in this project.

## What volumes are available?

To provide wide geographic and temporal coverage throughout Louisiana while also limiting the amount of disk space needed we devised the following criteria:

- Include the earliest edition for every community, regardless of date.
- Include any editions published through 1910 for all communities outside of New Orleans.
- Include only the earliest full coverage of New Orleans (in four volumes, from 1885 to 1893).

![Mamou: 1919 available (earliest edition), 1927 and 1946 unavailable (published after 1910)](img/volumes-grayed-out.png)

Applied across the state, these criteria produce 268 volumes covering 138 communities, with a combined sheet count of over 1600.

# Loading Volumes

=== "Basic concept"
	To begin working on a volume, we must copy all of its scanned map files from the Libary of Congress digital collection into our system.

=== "Tell me more..."
	This loading process acquires map scan JPGs through the LOC's [JSON API](https://www.loc.gov/apis/json-and-yaml/), and registers them as Documents in this content management system. Metadata like regional keywords and dates are also ingested and attached to the Documents at this time, to facilite facet searches and other lookups in the [Documents search page](https://oldinsurancemaps.net/documents).

From the [Volumes page]("https://oldinsurancemaps.net"), we begin by finding the city and year we are interested in.

Entering the 1892 volume, we can either preview the contents in the Library of Congress IIIF viewer, or click **Load Sheets** to begin the georeferencing process.

[show image with one sheet loaded]

You can click the refresh button (or reload the page) and sheets will be added to the display as they are loaded. After one sheet is ready, we can go ahead and prepare it. The other sheets will continue to load in the background.

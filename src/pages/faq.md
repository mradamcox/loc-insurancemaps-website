## Why isn't my city listed?
    
If a city does not appear in the "Start a new volume" list, then there is no Sanborn map of it in the LOC collection. However, do check for old names of your city, or the names of adjacent communinities that may have combined with yours over the years.

## Why are some volumes in the list grayed out?

This means the volume exists in the LOC collection but is not available for georeferencing in this project.

## What volumes are available?

To provide wide geographic and temporal coverage throughout Louisiana while also limiting the amount of disk space needed we devised the following criteria:

- Include the earliest edition for every community, regardless of date.
- Include any editions published through 1910 for all communities outside of New Orleans.
- Include only the earliest full coverage of New Orleans (in four volumes, from 1885 to 1893).

![Mamou: 1919 available (earliest edition), 1927 and 1946 unavailable (published after 1910)](../../static/img/volumes-grayed-out.png)

Applied across the state, these criteria produce 268 volumes covering 138 communities, with a combined sheet count of over 1600.

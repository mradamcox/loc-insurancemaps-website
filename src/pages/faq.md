# Frequently Asked Questions

If you don't see what you're looking for here, feel free to [get in touch](/contact).

## My city isn't on here, why not?

For now, the site only has maps that were included in the 2022 pilot project, which included a wide range of Sanborn editions across Louisiana (see below for more details).

## How can we add more volumes?

Once I have reimplemented the georeferencing capabilities on the site, I am open to adding more items from the [Library of Congress collection](https://loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps) on an *ad hoc* basic (especially for smaller cities and towns).

[Fill out this Google form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeF6iQibKEsjIv4fiYIW4vVVxyimLL8sDLX4BLU7HSWsRBOFQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

If you or your organization would like to sponsor the addition of **all Sanborn maps in your county or state** I would love to discuss how to work with you, just [get in touch](/contact).

## What volumes were included in the pilot project?

To provide wide geographic and temporal coverage throughout Louisiana while also limiting the amount of disk space needed we devised the following criteria:

- Include the earliest edition for every community, regardless of date.
- Include any editions published through 1910 for all communities outside of New Orleans.
- Include only the earliest full coverage of New Orleans (in four volumes, from 1885 to 1893).

![Mamou: 1919 available (earliest edition), 1927 and 1946 unavailable (published after 1910)](../../static/img/volumes-grayed-out.png)

Applied across the state, these criteria produce 268 volumes covering 138 communities, with a combined sheet count of over 1,600.

## Why are you using the term "volume"?

We are using this term somewhat imprecisely, because only Sanborn maps of large cities have proper "volumes" (see [New Orleans 1885 vol. 1](https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn03376_001/), [1885 vol. 2](https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn03376_002/), [1887 vol. 3](https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn03376_003/), and [1893 vol. 4](https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn03376_004/)). The vast majority of maps in the Sanborn collection may be better called "editions" (see [Baton Rouge, 1885](https://www.loc.gov/item/sanborn03275_001/)).

However, the hierarchy of the LOC collection handles editions and volumes at the same level, they are "items", so we decided "volume" would be a reasonable compromise for the sake of unity. Therefore, **a volume is an atomic unit that contains one or more sheets**. (This is not actually a FAQ, I just wanted to get it out of the way.)
